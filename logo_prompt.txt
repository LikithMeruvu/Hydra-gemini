**Hydra Project Logo Prompt**

**Concept:** A sleek, modern, abstract representation of a "Hydra" (multi-headed serpent) fused with digital/network aesthetics.

**Style:** 
- Minimalist Tech / Cyberpunk
- Vector Art / App Icon style
- Dark Mode optimized

**Elements:**
- **Central Core (The Gateway):** A glowing hexagonal or circular hub representing the central API gateway.
- **The Heads (The Keys):** 3 to 5 stylized "heads" or data streams branching out from the core. These shouldn't be literal snake heads, but rather abstract nodes, circuits, or fiber-optic strands that curve like serpertine necks.
- **Resilience:** The design should imply that if one strand breaks, others take over (interconnected mesh).

**Colors:**
- Background: Deep Void Black (`#09090b`) or Dark Slate (`#111116`).
- Primary Accent: Electric Purple (`#8b5cf6`) to Neon Blue (`#3b82f6`) gradient.
- Highlights: Cyan (`#06b6d4`) or Green (`#10b981`) for "active/online" status.

**Composition:**
- Centered, symmetrical or balanced asymmetry.
- Suitable for a square avatar (GitHub) or favicon.
- No text inside the logo mark itself.

**Mood:** 
- Powerful, Infinite, Resilient, Fast.
